## Roadblocks and Possible Solutions :construction: :bulb:

- Having everyoneâ€™s machine work with React.
  - If this is an issue then we can switch to Flutter and see if that works, otherwise confer with others to find a better solution that works for everyone.
- Either the Frontend or Backend team falling behind.
  - If this happens the best course would be to get some assistance from the other side until caught up
- Running into AWS Tech Stack Issues.
  - If for any reason we are having a hard time with utilizing AWS in the early stages of development then we immediately switch over to MERN as it is similar.
- Issues with Amazon Kendra or Lex
  - If we are having a hard time developing either of these two, or the cost becomes abnormally high then we switch to alternatives. If not enough available time then switch AI assistance with the next available stretch goal.

<br>

## Competition :vs:

- Blackboard, Canvas (No dedicated collaboration focus)
- Discord, Slack, GroupMe, Microsoft Teams (General communication tools)
- StudyBlue, Quizlet (Study tools without collaboration focus)
- Google Classroom (Limited collaboration features)
