## Roadblocks and Possible Solutions :construction: :bulb:

- Either the Frontend or Backend team falling behind.
  - If this happens the best course would be to get some assistance from the other side until caught up
  - Worst case scenario we move on and focus on implementing the important features
- Running into AWS Tech Stack Issues.
  - If for any reason we are having a hard time with utilizing AWS in the early stages of development then we immediately switch over to another Database like MongoDB, Firebase, â€¦.

<br>

## Competition :vs:

- LeetCode and HackerRank built-in hints
  - (limited and often locked behind paywalls)
- Educational YouTube channels and tutorials
  - (require switching platforms and are static)
- Coding blogs like GeeksforGeeks
  - (comprehensive but lack real-time integration)
- Browser extensions for syntax help
  - (doesnâ€™t focus on specific coding challenge platforms)
